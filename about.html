                Born Jan. 24, 1994 in Miami, Edwin Joshua Exaus hopes to become an influential fashion journalist for his generation.</p>

                <p>The boy destined for a future in fashion journalism came from a very modest background. His father was an entrepreneur and his mother a nurse. With his mother in the medical field, it was only natural that she had high aspirations for her son to be a doctor or something great within the field. But he had a different vision.</p>

                <p>By the time he was twelve, Edwin had taken a keen interest in fashion. Secondary school was a time when his fashion sense developed. He started to care about his appearance and how others perceived him.  Each year his love for fashion grew and his parents began to take note.</p>

                <p>It wasn’t until college when he implemented all of his fashion industry plans. He declared a double major in fashion journalism and health science. From that moment on, Edwin has put his dreams of being a successful African-American fashion magazine editor-and-chief in effect.</p>  

                <p>Today, at the tender age of 20, Edwin continues to build his brand with the new addition of his website Styleforensics.com. As he goes into his third year of college at the University of Florida, he remains to network with fashion industry heavy weights that will help him succeed in the future. It is only a matter of time before we see Edwin Exaus plastered across GQ or Vogue magazine.</p>
