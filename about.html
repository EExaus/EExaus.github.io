                Born Jan. 24, 1994 in Miami, Edwin Joshua Exaus has become an influential fashion journalist for his generation.</p>

                <p>The boy destined for a future in fashion journalism came from a very modest background. His father was an entrepreneur and his mother a nurse. With his mother in the medical field, it was only natural that she had high aspirations for her son to be a doctor or something great within the field. But he had a different vision.</p>

                <p>By the time he was twelve, Edwin had taken a keen interest in fashion. Secondary school was a time when his fashion sense developed. He started to care about his appearance and how others perceived him.  Each year his love for fashion grew and his parents began to take note.</p>

                <p>It wasn’t until college when he implemented all of his fashion industry plans. He declared a double major in fashion journalism and health science. From that moment on, Edwin has put his dreams of being a successful African-American fashion magazine editor-and-chief in effect.</p>  

                <p>In August 2012 he had the opportunity of joining Fashion X-Clusive’s executive board as public relations director. Being the youngest member of the executive board for the worlds largest collegiate fashion show, not only intimidated him but also proved that he could maintain a powerful position while under pressure. The show brought in about 900 people and he strives to bring in more next year as he steps into his new title as assistant director.</p>  

                <p>January 2013 brought Edwin a bigger opportunity. He was offered an internship at The Styling Firm under the direction of Taj McGill as fashion correspondent. His newfound journalism skills were put to the test on the red carpet at the company’s annual fashion mixer. His winning smile and charming attitude dominated the red carpet.</p>  

                <p>September 2014 he volunteered at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in New York City, an experience that has changed his life beyond immensely.</p>

                <p>Today, at the tender age of 20, Edwin continues to build his brand with the new addition of his website Styleforensics.com. As he goes into his third year of college at the University of Florida, he remains to network with fashion industry heavy weights that will help him succeed in the future. It is only a matter of time before we see Edwin Exaus plastered across GQ or Vogue magazine.</p>
